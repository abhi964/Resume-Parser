So that, it can mobilize its 40,000 workforce well in advance. And keep them prepared for any outage/incident that may occur anywhere across the globe. • We have design and developed the Volume Forecasting for customer services support volume across businesses using Machine Learning techniques such as Auto ARIMA, Stl Arima, GLM,GLS and DLM. • Design unified schema to deliver one source of truth to all forecasting leads. The data is scheduled daily to download from the client’s server, viz lighthouse and CSSODE server. The process is automated using SQL Server Agent job. • The control/data flow package is designed in SSIS. And also, configured for full load and incremental load. • When the forecasting is done for subsequent months. The Actual data is validated and this process is termed as Volume lock. • Variance Reports are created to track variance to forecast for the validation of forecast with the volume lock data. • A complete pipeline is created in azure data factory, to provide business owners a single point of contact to forecast data for their business units. Technical Skills • Azure Data Factory • Machine Learning • NLP • Deep Learning • Forecasting/Time series Analysis • Power BI • SQL Server 2016 • Python • SSIS • JIRA • Jenkins • GitHub • Unix • C++11 Education NIRMA UNIVERSITY | M.TECH Mechanical Engineering, 8.34/10 2013-2015 | Ahmedabad, India UPES | B.TECH Aerospace Engineering, 2.7/4 2008-2012 | Dehradun, India H.S.C (CBSE) | 2007-2008 76.60 PERCENTAGE S.S.C (CBSE) | 2005-2006 78.80 PERCENTAGE Courses • Coursera – University of Washington, ML • Udemy – Data Science Bootcamp for beginners • Classroom training for Big Data Technologies from ETL Hive, Pune. Co-curricular Activities • Runner up of NIRMA University M.Tech cricket league tournament 2015 • Winner of NIRMA University Fresher’s cup volleyball tournament 2014. • Runner up in Intra University Cricket tournament, 2010. Personal Details Current Company: HCL Tech. Location : Noida, UP Status : Married DOB : 10th Mar 1991 February/2016 to April/2018 Cognizant Technology Solution Programmer Analyst, Pune Feed Transformation Engine, Elektron • Thomson Reuters Elektron is a suite of data and trading propositions, including low latency feeds along with the analytics, enterprise platform and transactional connectivity to support any workflow application. • All of these capabilities can be deployed at a customer location or delivered as a fully managed service from any one of our co-location and proximity hosting sites around the globe. • I was part of the team which developed FTE (Feed Transformation Engine) for Elektron.FTE has three modules Line Interface and Message Decoder includes connection with the exchange and mapping of the market data with the field Id’s. • Lookup module stores the identification for future reference of the market data. Where each transaction has a unique system identification, which is then converted to a Reuters identification code. The conversion logic is provided to us by the business analyst. • Transform is mostly business logic and was provided by the client and we had to integrate with our other two modules. • The libraries are then deployed into the development box, to carry out the testing from my end. And in parallel the QA team starts testing the libraries with their pre-defined tests. • Any bug raised through JIRA is then resolved by the development team and QA team rechecks the functionality to finally close the ticket in JIRA. • The final libraries are then deployed in the client side soak box, where the client tests the libraries with their test cases.'"
